    <h2>üß¨ Case Study 1: The Michigan Breakthrough</h2>
    <p>One client had searched for her biological father for over a decade. With GEDmatch segment analysis and match triangulation, we narrowed down her top matches and built a hypothesis tree. Within weeks, she had confirmation‚Äîand a reunion.</p>

    <h2>üå≥ Case Study 2: The Sibling Surprise</h2>
    <p>A man from California discovered a half-sibling through unexpected DNA matches. We verified the connection using shared segments and helped him reach out with sensitivity and support. They‚Äôve since begun building a relationship.</p>

    <h2>üîç Case Study 3: Citizenship by Descent</h2>
    <p>Another client needed documentation for dual citizenship. We combined traditional records with DNA evidence to build a verified five-generation tree. Her application was accepted‚Äîand her family history preserved.</p>
